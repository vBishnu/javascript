Day 19: Variables, Array and Objects


Variables: 

JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

var (older method)
let (newer method)
const (newer method)


When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables.
2. Always use "const" if the value should not be changed.
3. Always use "const" if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects).
4. Only use "let" if you cannot use "const".
5. Never use "var" if you can use "let" or "const".

Data Types

Strings = Strings are text written inside quotes. "Ram"
Numbers = Numbers are written without quotes.   22


Array:
An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.
const names = ["Ram", "Shyam", "Hari"];
Array values are stored inside "[]" braces.

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number. The index numbers start from 0, here 0=Ram, 1= Shyam.

console.log(name['0']})
Ram

Ie can use console.log(names) to view the values stored. 


Objects:
An object literal is a list of property key:values inside curly braces { }.

const name1 = {
  name: "Sato",
  name: "gojoru",
  age: 28,
  eyeColor: "aao"
};
