Day 18 : Javascript

Javascript: 
It is a dynamic, interpreted, lightwieght, scripting language language. Many people confuse "Javascript" wit "JAVA" which is a different programming language. These programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use. 

- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape.
- It was developed in just 10 days and was originally called Mocha, later renamed LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.
- Later in 2009 Node.js and Ecma 5 released with major improvements:
- In 2015 the biggest update of javascript was released which introduced:
1. let and const
2. Arrow functions
3. Classes
4. Modules and many more... which turned javascript  into a modern and powerful programming language.

Now Javascript is used in Web browsers, Mobile apps (React Native), Desktop apps (Electron), Servers (Node.js),  Even AI and IoT



The Little Language That Woke Up the Web”

A bedtime story between a grandpa and his sleepy grandchild

Grandpa: Come here, little one. Snuggle in. Let me tell you a nighttime tale…
A tale about a tiny magical language called JavaScript.

Grandchild: Is it a real magic language, Grandpa?

Grandpa: Oh yes… and it changed the whole world while most people were asleep.

The Beginning – A Quiet and Lonely Web

Grandpa: Long, long ago, in the year 1995, the Web was quiet… almost too quiet.
Websites were like still paintings—pretty to look at, but they didn’t move or respond.
If you clicked, nothing happened. If you typed, no one listened.

Grandchild: Aww… that sounds lonely.

Grandpa: It was, my dear. The Web needed a little spark—a sprinkle of magic.

The Arrival of the Little Language

Grandpa: Then came a young wizard named Brendan Eich.
In just ten days—barely more than a week—he created a tiny magical creature.

They named it many names at first: Mocha… LiveScript…
But finally, they settled on JavaScript.

Grandchild: So JavaScript was like a baby wizard?

Grandpa: Exactly. A little magic-maker with big dreams.

Learning the Rules of the World

Grandpa: As JavaScript grew, it wandered the world of browsers—Netscape, Internet Explorer, and many others.
But each one taught it different rules…

One said, “Do it this way.”
Another said, “No, no, do it that way.”

And little JavaScript got confused.

Grandchild: Poor little thing…

Grandpa: Yes, that’s when the wise elders at ECMA took JavaScript in and taught it one proper, universal way.
That way, it could be understood everywhere.

The Sleepy Years

Grandpa: For a while, JavaScript grew slowly.
Sometimes it stumbled.
Sometimes websites needed a helper named jQuery just to understand it better.

But the little language never stopped trying.

The Great Awakening

Grandpa: Then something wonderful happened.
In 2009, JavaScript stretched its tiny arms… and suddenly grew stronger.
This new version was called ES5.

And soon after… Node.js appeared—a magical door that allowed JavaScript to leave the browser and explore whole new worlds.

Grandchild: Like going on an adventure?

Grandpa: Yes, my sweet one. The biggest adventure of its life.

Then in 2015, JavaScript had its greatest transformation—ES6.
It gained new skills, new tools, new powers.
It wasn’t a tiny language anymore—it became a true hero.

A Hero of the Modern Web

Grandpa: And today, little one, JavaScript is everywhere.
It runs on websites, phones, computers, TVs, and even robots.

Grandchild: Robots?? Really??

Grandpa: chuckles softly
Yes, even robots.
From a quiet ten-day creation to a global guardian of the Web…
JavaScript grew into something extraordinary.

Grandchild: Grandpa… I like JavaScript.
It’s like a little wizard that never gave up.

Grandpa: pulls blanket up to chin
Just like you, my dear.
Now close your eyes…
And maybe tomorrow, you’ll write a little magic of your own.

Grandchild: Goodnight, Grandpa. Goodnight, JavaScript.

Grandpa: Goodnight, little coder.
